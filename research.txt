Research for automating animation with a Wemos D1 mini

Operational Parameters
1. Hardware WEMOS D1 mini with 8 NeoPixel rings consisting of 120 NeoPixels (RGB) LEDs. WS2812. 

Problem statement
The WEMOS D1 mini has limited memory and the amount of frames we want to store may be large. Possible solution is to use a SD Card on which we can store the needed data (Reading will cost additional code space limiting the memory capacity). 

Simple implementation
Store the frames in files on the SD card. Place a menu list with possible animations on the SD Card.

SD Storage structure
/
	Menu.lst		File consisting of the menu item and associated filename
	Filename.anim		Animation file that will be available
	File2.anim		Another animation file.

Menu.lst format
Filename.anim|Menu Title
File2.anim|Second Menu Item

Anim File format
Byte Array of 4 x 120 bytes, each group of 4 is build as follows:
[R][G][B][C] Where each byte provides the following:
R	Red component of the Led
G	Green component of the Led
B	Blue component of the Led 
C	Control, allowing commands to be incorporated. Currently to be designed and will have the value 0.
